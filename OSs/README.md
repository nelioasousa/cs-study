# Summary
An operating system (OS) is a system software that serves as an intermediary between the hardware and application programs. It manages all the physical resources within a computer and orchestrates all the processes running on it, like user programs and background services. The OS facilitates efficient utilization of the computer's capabilities by mediating between programs and the physical resources they require, such as memory, network access, persistent storage, and I/O operations. Among the key features implemented by operating systems there are multitasking, multi-user support, virtual memory, memory protection, and common services for programs.
